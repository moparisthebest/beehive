Beehive

[![Build Status](https://ci.moparisthe.best/job/moparisthebest/job/beehive/job/master/badge/icon%3Fstyle=plastic)](https://ci.moparisthe.best/job/moparisthebest/job/beehive/job/master/)

Releases are available on maven central, snapshots on oss.sonatype.org

This is a (barely) maintained fork of beehive that still works with modern java, for legacy applications that still need beehive.  You should NEVER use this in a new application, please use Spring or anything else.

Whether you use this or not, I recommend [JdbcMapper](https://github.com/moparisthebest/JdbcMapper) as a drop-in, modern, safe replacement for beehive JdbcControls.
